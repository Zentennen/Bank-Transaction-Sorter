# Bank Transaction Sorter
 This is a small application I wrote that takes data from my bank transfers and organizes it into an excel document. 
 I wrote it using a free version of xlsx, which means I can only access 50 rows of data from the input excel document,
 however, I needed to access more than 50 rows. The 50 row limit is applied for each time the application is run, so
 I made an application that runs another application that handles the data multiple times.

The application processes all files in the Input folder and then outputs an Economy.xlsx which consists of all the
data in the Input files organized by year in a single xlsx file.
